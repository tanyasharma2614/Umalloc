How to run
1. make clean
2. make all
3. ./memgrind.c

Note: TimeOverhead and ItermediateCoalescence will individually take around 20mins each as they also have saturation function. So in order to save time you can comment out saturation fucntiona and any other respective function and then run memgrind.c

Note: TimeOverhead will show some Deallocation error due to excess space in array
